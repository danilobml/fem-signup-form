## Overview

Done with Tailwind CSS, which I am still learning, so it was tricky. It was especially tough to do the sizing. The JavaScript validation was a bit tricky too. I'd appreciate any tips and comments to improve and learn! Thank you!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_
